### About
Graduated from St. Petersburg University of Economics and Finance, I started my career in business literature publishing.

The experience gained allowed me to go freelance, so I started working for myself. Two years ago, I completed a one-year retraining course as a web designer at Peter the Great Polytechnic University. And here I fully realized that this is only the tip of the iceberg, and the frontend captures me with my head. And this is just the beginning...
